## 🛠 Production Checklist

When you're ready to go live:

- [ ] Switch to live Stripe keys (`pk_live_` and `sk_live_`)
- [ ] Set up production webhook endpoint
- [ ] Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` to your production URL
- [ ] Test with real payment methods
- [ ] Set up email notifications for orders
- [ ] Configure database storage for order tracking
- [ ] Set up monitoring for failed payments

## 📞 What Happens After Payment?

Currently, the webhook logs successful payments. You'll want to implement:

1. **Database Storage**: Save orders to your database
2. **Email Notifications**: Send confirmation emails to customers
3. **Team Notifications**: Alert your team about new orders
4. **Service Delivery**: Start your Google My Business work
5. **Order Management**: Build admin interface for tracking orders

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

Run the environment checker to diagnose issues:
```bash
npm run check-env
```

Common issues:
- Make sure all environment variables are set correctly
- Verify webhook endpoint is accessible (use ngrok for local testing)
- Check Stripe Dashboard for payment and webhook logs
